# CodePulse AI
**From Test Plan to Automation – Instantly**

---

## 🌟 Overview
CodePulse AI, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o and Omini-3, is an advanced tool designed to automate and streamline the creation of testing artifacts from HAR or Postman collection files. By leveraging the intelligent capabilities of GPT-4o and Omini-3, CodePulse AI significantly reduces the effort required to generate comprehensive testing documentation and scripts.

With just a few clicks, developers and testers can quickly transform HAR or Postman collection files into structured test plans, test scenarios, detailed test cases, and Playwright automation scripts.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Test Plan Generation:** Automatically creates a structured test plan that outlines testing objectives, scope, and strategy.
- **Test Scenario Generation:** Identifies high-level test scenarios from extracted API endpoints, providing clear guidance on testing coverage.
- **Test Case Generation:** Generates detailed test cases with step-by-step instructions for efficient validation.
- **Automation Code Generation:** Creates Playwright test scripts for identified API endpoints, allowing for quick and reliable automated testing.
- Sample Playwright Framework: Provides a dedicated button to download a sample Playwright framework, making it easy for users to set up their testing environment.

✨ Each output can be easily downloaded directly to the user's Downloads folder. Additionally, the tool includes a dedicated button to download a sample Playwright framework, simplifying the setup process. For added convenience, a built-in chatbot is available to assist users with testing-related queries and help with any questions regarding CodePulse AI.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: To manage dependencies and run the application.

- npm or yarn: To install the required dependencies.

- Azure OpenAI API Key: (If using Azure OpenAI) For integration with Azure OpenAI models.

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for designing the UI.

- Azure OpenAI: AI models to analyze and generate test cases based on API calls.

- File Handling: For uploading and parsing HAR files.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### Step 1: Upload a HAR File or Postman Collection file
Upload a HAR file or Postman Collection file to CodePulse AI. The tool will automatically filter out irrelevant data, such as:
- Irrelevant headers
- Excluded file extensions (e.g., `.js`, `.css`, `.png`, etc.)
- Excluded domains (e.g., analytics and tracking services)
- Duplicate API requests to ensure that only unique and essential endpoints are processed

This intelligent filtering ensures that the OpenAI API generates accurate and efficient outputs.

### Step 2: Generate Testing Artifacts
Choose from one of the following options:
- **Generate Test Plan** - Outlines testing objectives and scope
- **Generate Test Scenarios** - Lists high-level testing scenarios
- **Generate Test Cases** - Details step-by-step validation instructions
- **Generate Code** - Produces Playwright test scripts

### Step 3: Download Results
Instantly download the generated content, including structured documentation and automation scripts.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pratham-Software-Inc/CodePluse-AI.git
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Start Application
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables 
You can configure the OpenAI API settings using either of the following two methods:

***Method 1: Using the UI (Recommended)***
1. After starting the application.
2. Navigate to the UI in your browser.
3. Click on the `OpenConfig` link.
4. Enter and save your OpenAI API Key, Endpoint, and API Version, Model, Max Token Size and Batch Size directly from the configuration screen.
5. Click Save

***Method 2: Using the .env File***
Update `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint_here
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-02-15-preview
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_TOKEN_SIZE=token_size
VITE_AZURE_OPENAI_API_BATCH_SIZE=batch_size

```
### Verify OpenAI Configurations
After Saving again reach on OpenConfig Screen
Click `Test Connection`
Successful connection will give OpenAI Generated Message Response.
